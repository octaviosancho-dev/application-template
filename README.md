## Technologies Used
[List the technologies used in the project]

Example:
- .NET 8
- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (optional, if used)
- RabbitMQ (optional, for microservices)
- React.js (if it's a web app)
- Azure/AWS (if cloud deployment)
- XUnit (for testing)

---

## Requirements
To run the application locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **.NET SDK**: Version [specify version].
- **Docker** (for optional containerization): [link to Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB**, depending on the database being used.

---

## Installation and Configuration

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository

2. **Configure .env or appsettings.json**
Make sure to set up database credentials and other environment variables. Example for appsettings.json:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=mydb;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword"
  },
  "JwtSettings": {
    "Secret": "YourJwtSecretKey"
  }
}
```
If you're using a .env file, define the key variables:

```makefile
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=mydb
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```
---
3. **Install dependencies. Run:**

```bash
dotnet restore
```
---

## Running the Application
### Option 1: Running Locally

1. **Build the project:**
```bash
dotnet build
```
2. Run the application:
```bash
dotnet run --project [ProjectName.csproj]
```
3. Access the application: The application will be available at http://localhost:7000 (or the configured port).

### Option 2: Running with Docker

1. Build and run containers with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
2. Access the application:
API available at: http://localhost:7000
Database (PostgreSQL): localhost:5432

---

## Testing
To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Run unit tests:
```bash
dotnet test
```

2. Integration tests: If you have integration tests configured, they can also be run as part of a CI pipeline or locally.

---

## Endpoints (if it's an API)

### Users:
- GET /api/users: Get all users.
- POST /api/users: Create a new user.
- GET /api/users/{id}: Get a user by ID.
- PUT /api/users/{id}: Update a user.
- DELETE /api/users/{id}: Delete a user.

### Orders:
- GET /api/orders: List all orders.
- POST /api/orders: Create an order.

---

## Project Architecture

[Briefly describe the project structure, especially if it's a microservices system]

```bash
/src
  /ServiceAPI         # Main API project
  /ServiceAPI.Tests   # Unit and integration test project
  /Dockerfile         # Dockerfile to containerize the API
  /docker-compose.yml # Docker Compose for orchestrating the app
  /ClientApp          # Frontend project (if applicable)
```

If it's a microservices system, specify the services and how they communicate (e.g., RabbitMQ, gRPC, etc.).

---

## Deployment

1. Production Environment: [Provide specific instructions for deploying to production: Docker, Azure, AWS, etc.]
2. Docker (Production):
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```
